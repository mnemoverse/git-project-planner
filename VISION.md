# Vision & Philosophy

## 🎯 Core Mission

**Git Project Planner is a unified development environment that keeps your entire team — humans, AI agents, and business stakeholders — working in a single context.**

The goal is simple: **minimize external dependencies, maximize Git-native workflows, automate everything possible.**

## 🌍 The Big Picture

### The Problem We Solve

Modern development involves too many disconnected tools:
- Planning in Jira/Linear/Asana
- Design in Figma
- Discussions in Slack
- Documentation in Confluence/Notion
- Code in GitHub
- Knowledge scattered everywhere

**Result**: Context switching, lost information, fragmented team understanding, AI agents that can't see the full picture.

### Our Solution

**Everything lives in Git.**

```
Git Repository = Single Source of Truth
    ├── Code (what we build)
    ├── Planning (why we build it)
    ├── Design specs (how it should work)
    ├── Decisions (why we chose this)
    └── Context (everything else)
```

### Why This Matters

1. **Unified Context**: AI agents see the same context as humans
2. **Version Control**: Planning evolves with code, full history
3. **Collaboration**: Git workflows everyone already knows
4. **Offline-First**: Work anywhere, sync when ready
5. **Simple**: Plain text, no vendor lock-in
6. **Automated**: CI hooks, scripts, bots do the boring work

## 🤖 Team = Humans + AI Agents

This system is designed for **hybrid teams**:

### Human Developers
- Need clear specs and priorities
- Want to minimize tool switching
- Appreciate good documentation
- Value fast workflows

### AI Coding Agents (Claude, Cursor, Copilot)
- Need structured context in files
- Work best with markdown specs
- Can read planning alongside code
- Benefit from consistent templates

### Business Stakeholders
- Need visibility into progress
- Want to understand priorities
- Don't want to learn developer tools
- Appreciate GitHub Projects UI

### Design & Product
- Contribute specs as markdown
- Review changes via PRs
- See full history of decisions
- Integrate Figma links in tasks

## 🔧 Design Principles

### 1. Git-Native First

**Philosophy**: If it can live in Git, it should live in Git.

```
✅ YES - In Git:
- Task specifications (.md files)
- Sprint plans (.md files)
- Roadmaps (.md files)
- Design specs (.md files)
- Decision logs (.md files)
- Architecture docs (.md files)

⚠️ OPTIONAL - External with Links:
- Figma designs (link in task)
- Slack discussions (summary in task)
- Video demos (link + transcript)

❌ NO - Keep External Only When Necessary:
- Real-time chat (Slack)
- Live design collaboration (Figma)
- Synchronous meetings (Zoom)
```

### 2. Automate Everything Possible

**Philosophy**: Humans shouldn't do what machines can do.

**Automation Layers**:

```
Layer 1: Git Hooks (pre-commit, post-merge)
    └── Auto-format markdown
    └── Update task status
    └── Validate frontmatter

Layer 2: CI/CD Workflows
    └── Sync to GitHub Issues
    └── Update GitHub Projects
    └── Generate progress reports
    └── Notify stakeholders

Layer 3: Scripts (run manually)
    └── Sprint planning
    └── Retrospectives
    └── Reports generation
```

**Examples**:
- Task status changes on PR merge
- GitHub Project cards auto-move
- Sprint metrics auto-calculate
- Reports auto-generate

### 3. Minimal External Connectors

**Philosophy**: Use external tools only when they provide unique value.

```
CORE (required):
└── Git + GitHub - source control, issues, projects

OPTIONAL (use sparingly):
├── Slack - real-time chat, notifications only
├── Figma - visual design, link in specs
├── CI/CD - automation, not storage
└── Observability - monitoring, not planning

AVOID (unless absolutely necessary):
├── Jira - redundant with GitHub
├── Confluence - redundant with docs/
├── Notion - redundant with markdown
└── Separate project management tools
```

### 4. Structured for AI Agents

**Philosophy**: AI agents are first-class team members.

**AI-Friendly Patterns**:

```markdown
# Tasks with Clear Structure
---
task_id: "XXX-001"
title: "Feature name"
status: "InProgress"
---

## Objective
[One clear sentence]

## Requirements
- [ ] Requirement 1
- [ ] Requirement 2

## Technical Approach
[Implementation strategy]

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Specific criteria
```

**Why This Matters**:
- AI can parse frontmatter automatically
- Clear structure = better AI understanding
- Checklists = measurable progress
- Links connect context

### 5. Flexible, Not Rigid

**Philosophy**: Adapt the system, don't force the system.

**Flexibility Points**:
- Task templates can be customized
- Sprint length is configurable
- Label schemes are adaptable
- Workflows can be modified
- Scripts are simple bash/python

**NOT**:
- ❌ Enforced workflows
- ❌ Rigid tool requirements
- ❌ Mandatory processes
- ❌ Complex abstractions

## 🚀 Usage Patterns

### For Solo Developers

```bash
# Minimal setup
./scripts/setup-project.sh
vim planning/current-sprint.md
# Work on code
./scripts/update-sprint.sh
```

**Benefits**:
- Clear priorities
- Historical record
- AI agents can help
- Professional structure

### For Small Teams (2-5 people)

```bash
# Setup with GitHub integration
./scripts/setup-project.sh --repo owner/name
./scripts/sync-tasks.sh
# Team works on tasks
# GitHub Project shows progress
```

**Benefits**:
- Shared context
- Clear ownership
- Progress visibility
- Async-friendly

### For Hybrid Teams (Humans + AI)

```bash
# Full automation
./scripts/setup-project.sh
# Configure CI/CD hooks
# AI agents read task specs
# Humans review AI PRs
# System tracks everything
```

**Benefits**:
- AI has full context
- Humans maintain control
- Automated tracking
- Unified workflow

## 🎪 Integration Strategy

### Core: GitHub Issues + Projects

**Why GitHub**:
- Developers already use it
- Integrates with code naturally
- Good API for automation
- Visual boards for stakeholders
- Free for public/small teams

**Usage**:
```
Task.md → GitHub Issue → Project Card
Code PR → Closes Issue → Card to Done
```

### Optional: Slack for Notifications

**Pattern**: Notifications only, not discussions

```yaml
# CI sends to Slack:
- "Sprint started: Week 42"
- "Task completed: XXX-001"
- "Blocker: XXX-005 needs review"

# Discussions stay in:
- GitHub PR comments
- Task markdown files
- Weekly retrospectives
```

### Optional: Figma for Design

**Pattern**: Link, don't embed

```markdown
## Design
- Figma: https://figma.com/...
- Screenshots: docs/designs/feature-xxx.png
- Decisions: See ADR-001-ui-pattern.md
```

### No Integration: Jira/Linear/etc

**Why**: Redundant with Git + GitHub

If you must use them:
```bash
# One-way sync only
./scripts/export-to-jira.sh  # Not included, write if needed
```
