# PROJ-002: Fix Memory Leak in API Endpoint

## 🎯 Objective

Identify and fix memory leak in `/api/data` endpoint that causes server to crash after ~1000 requests.

## 📖 Background

**Issue**: Production server crashes every 2-3 hours during peak traffic.
**Impact**: Downtime, poor user experience, manual restarts required.
**Root cause**: Suspected memory leak in data processing endpoint.

**Evidence**:
- Memory grows linearly with requests
- Heap snapshots show retained objects
- GC not freeing memory

## ✅ Requirements

- [ ] Identify source of memory leak
- [ ] Fix the leak
- [ ] Verify memory stays stable under load
- [ ] Add monitoring to detect future leaks
- [ ] Document findings

## 🔧 Technical Approach

1. **Reproduce locally**
   - Load test with 1000+ requests
   - Monitor memory with profiler
   - Capture heap snapshots

2. **Identify leak**
   - Compare heap snapshots
   - Find retained objects
   - Trace to source code

3. **Fix**
   - Close connections properly
   - Clear event listeners
   - Release references

4. **Verify**
   - Repeat load test
   - Monitor memory for 1 hour
   - Confirm GC works

### Tools
- Node.js profiler
- Chrome DevTools
- k6 for load testing

## 📋 Definition of Done

- [ ] Memory leak identified and documented
- [ ] Fix implemented and tested
- [ ] Load test shows stable memory (1h+ runtime)
- [ ] Memory monitoring added to dashboard
- [ ] Postmortem document written
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged
- [ ] Deployed to production
- [ ] No crashes for 48h

## 📊 Acceptance Criteria

1. **Given** 10,000 requests, **When** endpoint processes them, **Then** memory increases <10MB total
2. **Given** server running 24h, **When** checked, **Then** memory is stable
3. **Given** alert threshold set, **When** memory spikes, **Then** team gets notified

- **Production incident**: INC-123
- **Monitoring**: Grafana dashboard
- **Similar issue**: PROJ-098 (previous memory leak)

## 📝 Investigation Log

### Oct 8, 10:00 - Initial investigation
- Heap snapshot shows 50MB retained
- Objects: Buffer instances not released
- Source: data processing function

### Oct 8, 11:30 - Root cause found
- Event listeners not removed
- `request` event keeps reference to buffer
- Fix: Remove listener in cleanup

### Oct 8, 13:00 - Fix implemented
- Added cleanup function
- Removed event listeners explicitly
- Testing in progress

## 🧪 Testing Plan

1. **Load Test**:
   ```bash
   k6 run --vus 100 --duration 10m load-test.js
   ```

2. **Memory Monitoring**:
   ```bash
   node --inspect server.js
   # Monitor in Chrome DevTools
   ```

3. **Production Verification**:
   - Deploy to staging first
   - Run for 6 hours
   - Monitor memory via Grafana
   - Roll out to prod if stable

## 🔥 Urgency

**Priority**: P0 - Production down
**SLA**: Fix within 4 hours
**Communication**: Update stakeholders every hour
