Title: KD-009 Replace KD-internal vector store usage with vector_stores module

Type: Refactor

Rationale
- KD defines/assumes its own VectorStore interface. The repository already has a full `vector_stores/` module with providers and interfaces. KD should depend on it instead of duplicating.

Goals / Scope
- Update `KnowledgeDeltaFactory` to create vector stores via `vector_stores.factory.VectorStoresFactory`.
- Change KD to type against `vector_stores.interface.VectorStoreInterface`.
- Ensure `find_similar_deltas` and `store_delta` use the unified interface (`insert`, `search`, `update`, `delete`).

Acceptance Criteria
1) KD compiles with `vector_stores` interfaces and passes existing KD search tests.
2) Vector store provider is configurable via env or config and can be mocked via the moduleâ€™s own mock provider in tests.

Proposed Changes
- Factory wiring; minor method signature adjustments; remove KD-local stubs.

Test Plan (TDD)
- Configure a Mock vector store; run KD search tests end-to-end.
