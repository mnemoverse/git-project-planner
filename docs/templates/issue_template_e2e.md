# TDD: KD End-to-End Integration Test Suite

## 🎯 Overview

Implement comprehensive end-to-end integration test suite that validates the complete Knowledge Delta system flow from agent requests through Context Manager, KE Module, KD API, database operations, and back to formatted responses.

## 📋 Test Requirements

        query="How do neural networks learn?",
        session_id="session_123"
    )
    
    # Verify KE module was invoked
    assert "knowledge_evolution" in response1.context_modules
    assert response1.relevance == "HIGH"
    
    # Step 2: Agent asks follow-up question
    response2 = await send_agent_query(

    num_users = 100
    requests_per_user = 10
    
    async def user_simulation(user_id):
        """Simulate a user session with multiple queries"""
        agent_id = f"load-test-agent-{user_id}"
        session_id = f"session-{user_id}"
        
        responses = []
        for i in range(requests_per_user):
            query = f"Question {i} from user {user_id}"
            response = await send_agent_query(agent_id, query, session_id)
            responses.append(response)
            
            # Random delay between requests
            await asyncio.sleep(random.uniform(0.1, 1.0))
        
        return responses
    
    # Run concurrent user simulations
    start_time = time.time()
    
    tasks = [user_simulation(i) for i in range(num_users)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    
    total_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    # Verify performance requirements
    assert total_time < 120  # Complete within 2 minutes
    
    # Verify all requests succeeded
    total_responses = sum(len(user_responses) for user_responses in results)
    assert total_responses == num_users * requests_per_user
    
    # Verify response times
    response_times = [r.duration_ms for user_responses in results for r in user_responses]

    assert response1.success == True
    
    # Step 2: Simulate database failure
    await simulate_neo4j_failure()
    
    # Step 3: Request during failure (should degrade gracefully)
    response2 = await send_agent_query(agent_id, "Test query during failure")
    assert response2.success == True  # Graceful degradation
