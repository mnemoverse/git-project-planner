# GitHub Project Manual Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

1. GitHub account with access to `mnemoverse/smartkeys-v2` repository
2. Permission to create projects in the organization
3. GitHub CLI installed and authenticated (for post-setup automation)

## Manual Project Creation Steps

### Step 1: Create the Project

Create the following columns in order:

1. **ðŸ“‹ Backlog** - Tasks waiting to be scheduled
2. **ðŸ”„ Ready** - Sprint-ready tasks
3. **ðŸš€ In Progress** - Active development
4. **ðŸ‘€ Review** - Code review/testing
5. **âœ… Done** - Completed tasks

### Step 3: Add Custom Fields

Go to Project Settings â†’ Custom Fields and add:

### Step 4: Configure Automation Rules

Go to Workflows â†’ Add workflow:

#### Rule 1: Auto-move to column based on Status

  - Status = "In Progress" â†’ Move to "ðŸš€ In Progress"
  - Status = "Review" â†’ Move to "ðŸ‘€ Review"
  - Status = "Done" â†’ Move to "âœ… Done"
  - Status = "Blocked" â†’ Add ðŸš« label

#### Rule 2: Auto-set Status based on column
- **When**: Item moved to column
- **Then**: Set Status field
  - Moved to "ðŸ“‹ Backlog" â†’ Status = "Backlog"
  - Moved to "ðŸ”„ Ready" â†’ Status = "Ready"
  - Moved to "ðŸš€ In Progress" â†’ Status = "In Progress"
  - Moved to "ðŸ‘€ Review" â†’ Status = "Review"
  - Moved to "âœ… Done" â†’ Status = "Done"

#### Rule 3: Label sync
- **When**: Issue labeled
- **Then**: Update fields
  - Label contains "priority:" â†’ Set Priority field
  - Label contains "component:" â†’ Set Component field
  - Label contains "sprint:" â†’ Set Sprint field

### Step 5: Create Views

#### Default Board View
- Group by: Status
- Sort by: Priority (High to Low), then Created (Newest first)
- Filters: None (show all)

#### Sprint View
- Group by: Sprint
- Sort by: Status, Priority
- Filter: Sprint is not empty

#### Blocked Items View
- Group by: Component
- Filter: Status = "Blocked"
- Sort by: Created (Oldest first)

#### My Tasks View
- Group by: Status
- Filter: Assignee = @me
- Sort by: Priority, Updated

## Post-Setup Automation

Once the project is created, note down the Project ID (visible in URL) and run:

```bash
# Store project ID for automation
export GITHUB_PROJECT_ID="PVT_xxxxxxxxxxxx"

# Link existing issues to project
./Scripts/planning/link-issues-to-project.sh

# Sync task metadata
./Scripts/planning/sync-project-fields.sh
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Project created and named correctly
- [ ] All 5 columns created
- [ ] Custom fields configured (Status, Priority, Component, Sprint, Estimate)
- [ ] Automation rules active
- [ ] Views created and tested
- [ ] Project ID noted for automation scripts

## Next Steps

1. Run `link-issues-to-project.sh` to add all existing issues
2. Configure GitHub Actions to auto-add new issues
3. Set up daily sync automation
4. Create project dashboards for metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Can't create project
- Ensure you have organization permissions
- Check if projects are enabled for the repository

### Automation not working
- Verify workflow is enabled (not paused)
- Check workflow run history for errors
- Ensure fields are named exactly as specified

### Issues not appearing
- Check repository is linked to project
- Verify issue has correct labels
- Run manual sync script
